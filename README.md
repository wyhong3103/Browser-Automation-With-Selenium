# Quote Scraping Project with Selenium
This is a project that is done with Selenium, it allows us to interact with the browser, such as clicking a Button, selecting an option of a dropdown menu etc.

(At least these are what I learned along the way)
<br>
Run app.py to launch the program

Also, you will have to change the executive_path of the chromedriver in header.py to launch it!

## Module Needed to Launch This Program
-Selenium, Of Course.

## Words from me
Browser Automation is a really cool thing to do ! This is a project from a course, I am going to be developing my own project with it real soon!
